## What is this course about?

The course provides students with considerable experience to flexibly work with linear regression models and design of experiments. 
With the growth of automated systems, data analysis became an essential tool in engineering. 
The first part of the course introduces students to simple linear models, multiple linear models, model evaluation, model diagnosis, analysis of variance, residual analysis, and model selection. 
The second part of the course introduces students to design of experiments and commonly used designs such as the completely randomized design, randomized complete block design, and Latin squares design. 
The course also provides the students with experience handling data for engineering applications via in-class activities and assignments. 
The student completes a major project to answer a set of engineering questions and challenges.

**Format requirements**

See the top part of each provided homework Jupyter notebook for the format requirements.

## What do I need to know about the <font color="red">class project</font>?

There will be a team project in the second half of the semester.

See the [Project Guidelines](../project) for details. 

<!-- ## What are the <font color="red">exam</font> formats?

There is one midterm exam, which is scheduled on **Monday, March 28** during the lecture time (11:00 AM - 12:15 PM).

The exam is pen-and-paper based and will focus on the theoretical concepts and methods that we covered during the lectures using the whiteboard, slides, and Jupyter notebook non-coding notes. 
There will be *no* coding related questions.

**Formats**

- Closed book, closed notes.
- Cheatsheet
    - You may bring up to two (2) pieces of cheatsheet to an exam.
    - Each paper needs to be no larger than letter-size (8" x 11").
    - Double-sided is okay.
    - Note you can *not* bring more than two pieces of paper, even if they are single-sided or in smaller sizes.
    - The cheat sheet needs to be **handwritten by you**.
    - You are required to submit your cheatsheet along with your exam copy. Print your full name on the cheatsheet.
- A standalone scientific calculator is allowed. Sharing a calculator with another person is *not* allowed.

- You are allowed to consult with other students in the current class during the conceptualization of a problem. However, all written work, whether in scrap or final form, are to be generated by you working alone.
- You are required to disclose in each homework any person that you have discussed the homework with.
- You are *not* allowed to possess, look at, use, or in any way derive advantage from another student's work or the solutions prepared in prior semesters, whether the solutions were former students' work or copies of solutions that were made available by the instructors. 
- You are *not* allowed to discuss an homework with anyone outside the current class. 
- You are *not* allowed to compare your solutions, whether in scrap paper or final form, to another student.
- **Penalty policy**: 
  - A single offense will result in 0 points for the involved assignment *and* a reduction of three (3) letter grade levels in the final course grade (e.g., from A- to B-). 
  - Multiple offenses in homework will result in a failing grade (E) for the course. 
  - If a student provided unauthorized help to other students, all parties will receive the same penalty.
  - Once you have read this syllabus to completion, use *bonfire* as the answer to the question in the first homework.

<!-- **Exam rules**

- In an exam, you shall work alone. You may *not* receive (or give) any help from another person or unauthorized resource.
- Penalty policy: ***Any* offense in an exam will automatically result in a failing grade (E) for the course.** -->

However, the snippet must not constitute the core part of your work. 
And you need to properly cite the code snippets that you borrowed elsewhere.
<!-- - Work that includes material derived in any way from the efforts of another author, either by direct quotation or paraphrasing, should be fully and properly documented. 
To avoid plagiarism, you should cite all sources of both ideas and direct quotations, including those found on the internet.  -->
- You are not allowed to self-plagiarize, meaning that you can not submit your own previously produced work (e.g., from another course that you took or are currently taking).
