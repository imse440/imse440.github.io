## What is this course about?

The course provides students with considerable experience to flexibly work with linear regression models and design of experiments. 
With the growth of automated systems, data analysis became an essential tool in engineering. 
The first part of the course introduces students to simple linear models, multiple linear models, model evaluation, model diagnosis, analysis of variance, residual analysis, and model selection. 
The second part of the course introduces students to design of experiments and commonly used designs such as the completely randomized design, randomized complete block design, and Latin squares design. 
The course also provides the students with experience handling data for engineering applications via in-class activities and assignments. 
The student completes a major project to answer a set of engineering questions and challenges.

<!-- <h2><a id="homework">Homework</a></h2> -->
## What are the <font color="red">homework</font> policies and formats?

There will be roughly weekly homework (for a total of nine assignments). 

**Policies**

- All homework will be posted and submitted on Canvas.
- **Late homework will not be accepted** without a valid documented excuse. Barring extraordinary circumstances, the documented excuse must be available to the instructor at least two (2) academic calendar days prior to the deadline.
Valid excuses include your own illness or injury, family emergencies, certain University-approved curricular and extra-curricular activities, and religious holidays. 
- The excuses that will *not* be accepted, include, but are not limited to, 
  - missed the deadline by *any* amount of time
  - missed the deadline due to last-minute issues (e.g., network, computer)
  - submitted incomplete file(s) (e.g., missing the data files that are needed to run your code)
  - submitted a wrong file(s)
  - submitted to a wrong assignment
- It is recommended to budget enough time for submission. You can submit an unlimited number of times for each assignment. Only the latest submission will be graded. 
- **Your one lowest homework grade will be dropped when calculating the final grade.** No questions asked. An un-submitted work counts as zero.
- The solutions will be posted on Canvas after each homework deadline.
It is recommended to go through the solutions (even briefly) for your study purposes.

**Format requirements**

See the top part of each provided homework Jupyter notebook for the format requirements.

## What do I need to know about the <font color="red">class project</font>?

There will be an individual class project in the second half of the semester.

See the [Project Guidelines](../project) for details. 

## What are the <font color="red">exam</font> formats?

There is one midterm exam, which is scheduled on **Monday, March 28** during the lecture time (11:00 AM - 12:15 PM).

**Formats**

- Closed book, closed notes.
- Cheatsheet
    - You may bring up to two (2) pieces of cheatsheet to an exam.
    - Each paper needs to be no larger than letter-size (8" x 11").
    - Double-sided is okay.
    - Note you can *not* bring more than two pieces of paper, even if they are single-sided or in smaller sizes.
    - The cheat sheet needs to be **handwritten by you**.
    - You are required to submit your cheatsheet along with your exam copy. Print your full name on the cheatsheet.
- A standalone scientific calculator is allowed. Sharing a calculator with another person is *not* allowed.
- Cell phones, tablets, laptops, and any other devices are not allowed, and they should not be put on the desk top.

No makeup or early exam will be given without valid documented excuse and *prior* instructor consent. 

## What are the homework and exam <font color="red">regrading</font> policies?

- Regrade requests for homework or an exam must be made within ten (10) academic calendar days of when the assignment is returned and must be submitted to the instructor in writing. 
- The entire problem, not just the disputed parts, may be reviewed. Thus, it is possible to receive a lower grade than before.

## What are the <font color="red">Honor Code</font> policies?

UM-Dearborn values academic honesty and integrity. 
It is your responsibility to understand, accept, and comply with the University's standards of academic conduct as set forth by the 
[**Academic Code of Conduct**](http://catalog.umd.umich.edu/academic-policies-campus/academic-code-of-conduct/), 
as well as policies established by the schools and colleges. 
Cheating, collusion, misconduct, fabrication, and plagiarism are considered serious offenses. Violations will not be tolerated and may result in penalties up to and including expulsion from the University.

**General course rules**

- All course work (i.e., homework, exam, project) must represent your own work.
- **Avoiding plagiarism**: You are not allowed to submit, as your own, work that is not the result of your own labor and thoughts. 
Work that includes material derived in any way from the efforts of another author, either by direct quotation or paraphrasing, should be fully and properly documented. 
To avoid plagiarism, you should cite all sources of both ideas and direct quotations, including those found on the internet. 
The citation should provide enough information so that the original source of the material can be located.
- **All violations will be penalized and reported to the University's Academic Integrity Board (AIB) *with no exceptions*.**
- If you have any questions about whether something is or is not allowed, ask the instructor *beforehand*.


**Homework rules**

- All homework is to be completed on your own. 
- You are allowed to consult with other students in the current class during the conceptualization of a problem. However, all written work, whether in scrap or final form, are to be generated by you working alone.
- In each homework, you are required to disclose any person that you have discussed the homework with.
- You are *not* allowed to discuss the problem set with anyone outside the current class. 
- You are *not* allowed to possess, look at, use, or in any way derive advantage from another student's work or the solutions prepared in prior semesters, whether the solutions were former students' work or copies of solutions that were made available by the instructors. 
- You are *not* allowed to compare your solutions, whether in scrap paper or final form, to another student.
- **Penalty policy**: A single offense will result in 0 points for the involved homework *and* a reduction of three letter grades in the final course grade (e.g., from B+ to C+). Multiple offenses in homework will result in a failing grade (E) for the course. 
If a student provided unauthorized help to other students, all parties will receive the same penalty.
Once you have read this syllabus to completion, please use *serendipity* as the answer to the question in the first homework.

**Exam rules**

- In an exam, you shall work alone. You may *not* receive (or give) any help from another person or unauthorized resource.
- Penalty policy: ***Any* offense in an exam will automatically result in a failing grade (E) for the course.**



**Project rules**

- You are *not* allowed to receive any help on the project from another person other than the course instructor.
- The essence of all work that you submit for your project must be your own. 
You are allowed to use code snippets (defined as no more than a few lines of re-usable code) from the internet or elsewhere. 
However, the snippet must not constitute the core part of your work. 
And you need to properly cite the code snippets that you borrowed elsewhere.
- Work that includes material derived in any way from the efforts of another author, either by direct quotation or paraphrasing, should be fully and properly documented. 
To avoid plagiarism, you should cite all sources of both ideas and direct quotations, including those found on the internet. 
- You are not allowed to self-plagiarize, meaning that you can not submit your own previously produced work (e.g., from another course that you took or are currently taking).
- **Penalty policy**: An offense in a project will result in a penalty up to a failing grade (E) for the course.

## What are the <font color="red">copyright</font> policies?

You shall not send, upload, or distribute any of the course materials to another person or on the internet. 
The course materials include, but are not limited to, the lecture materials, homework, and exams.
