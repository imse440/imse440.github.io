Tools & technologies
--------------------

You will need access to a laptop computer that

- runs one of the following operating systems: Windows, MacOS, Unix
- has internet access
- has at least 2GB of hard drive space.


Lecture etiquette
-----------------

- Mute your mobile phones.
- Do not engage in private conversations during a lecture.
- We encourage you ask questions if you don't understand something. Just raise your hand. 
  Before asking a question, Please do think whether it is of general interest (e.g., the instructor might have just made a mistake) or it is really peculiar to you. 
  If it is peculiar to you, then catch the instructor at the end of the lecture or come to the office hours.
- If you have homework-related questions that requires more than a quick clarification, please come to the office hours or email the instructors. 

Homework
--------

There will be weekly homework for a total of eleven homework assignments. 

You can find the homework schedule on the course Google Calendar. 

Homework policies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- All homework will be posted and submitted on Canvas.

- **Late homework will not be accepted** without valid documented excuse. Barring extraordinary circumstances, the documented excuse must be available to the instructor at least two (2) academic calendar days prior to the deadline. Valid excuses include your own illness or injury, family emergencies, certain University-approved curricular and extra-curricular activities, and religious holidays. 
- It is recommended to budget enough time for submission. You can submit unlimited number of times for an assignment. Only the latest submission will be graded. 
- The excuses that will not be accepted include, but not limited to, 
  - missed the deadline by *any amount of time*,
  - missed the deadline due to last-minute technical or non-technical issues (e.g., network, computer),
  - submitted incomplete file(s) (e.g., missing the data files that are needed to run your code),
  - submitted a wrong file(s),
  - submitted to a wrong assignment.
- **Your one (1) lowest homework grade will be dropped when calculating the final grade.** No questions asked. An un-submitted work counts as zero.
- Homework solutions will be posted on Canvas after the deadlines.
  It is recommended to go through the solutions (even briefly) for your study purposes.

Homework format requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Use the provided Jupyter notebook file as the starting point, and include all your code and answers in it.
- Show your answers to the questions *clearly* and *explicitly*. 
  You can use the Markdown cells to type in your answers. 
  You can also use the ``print`` function to show the answers. 
  The bottom line is we do not have to search for the answers buried in your code or output. 
- You will submit a `ZIP <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_(file_format)>`__ file called ``imse440-hwX-yourUniqueName.zip``, where X is the number of the current homework. 
  For example, if I were to submit for homework 1, it would be called ``imse440-hw1-fredfeng.zip``.
- When I extract your compressed file, the result should be a directory called ``imse440-hwX-yourUniqueName``, 
  containing, at a minimum, a Jupyter notebook file called ``imse440-hwX-yourUniqueName.ipynb`` and all other files (e.g., data files) needed to run your notebook on my machine. 
  

.. attention::
    Homework without complete Honor Code signing will not be graded and get an automatic zero.

.. attention::
    In your submission, you need to include *all* necessary files (including data files, even if you didn't make any changes to them), so that we can run your code off the bat.
    We will not supply any files or make any changes before running your code on our machine. 

.. attention::
    You should make sure your submitted notebook does not generate errors.
    Before submission, you should click (on the JupyterLab menu) *Kernel -> Restart Kernel and Run All Cells...* to make sure it doesn't generate errors. 
    Also remember to use **relative paths** when specifying file locations. 
    **Any parts of your homework that generate errors (e.g., due to failing to read in data) will receive zero points**.


Homework general suggestions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **Start early!** If you run into software or coding issues, it may take time to solve. 
  It is best to find these problems early so we have time to help you.
- **Back up your work!** 
  I would recommend doing your work in a cloud file storage folder such as `Dropbox <https://its.umich.edu/communication/collaboration/dropbox>`__ (which is freely available for UM students). 
- **Make your code more readable** 
    - Do not write all your code in a single cell or several large cells. 
      Separate different parts of your code/answers in separate cells for better readability.
    - Use the Markdown cells to make your work more readable by briefly explaining what you are doing. 
    - Additionally, use comments in the code cells to explain your code.
    - Follow naming conventions (e.g., ``import pandas as pd``). 
    - Use meaningful variable names. 

Homework regrading policies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Regrade requests for homework must be made within ten (10) academic calendar days of when the assignment is returned and must be submitted to the instructor in writing. 
- The entire problem, not just the disputed parts, may be reviewed. Thus, it is possible to receive a lower grade than before. 
- There will be no regrading nor any grade changes after the last week of class.

Project
-------

There will be a team project in this class.
See the :ref:`Project guidelines` for details.

as well as policies established by the schools and colleges. 
Cheating, collusion, misconduct, fabrication, and plagiarism are considered serious offenses. Violations will not be tolerated and may result in penalties up to and including expulsion from the University.

General course rules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- All course work (homework, project) must represent your own work.
- **Avoiding plagiarism**: 
  You are not allowed to submit, as your own, work that is not the result of your own labor and thoughts. 
  
    - Work (your homework, project submissions) that includes materials (e.g., texts, codes, images, figures, tables, etc.) derived in any way from the efforts of another person, by direct quotation, paraphrasing, or editing, should be fully and properly documented. 
    - To avoid plagiarism, you should cite all sources of both ideas and direct quotations, including those found on the internet. 
    - The citation should provide enough information so that the original source of the material can be located.
- You are *not* allowed to share any of your lecture notes, codes, or other course materials with another student.
  If you was not able to attend a lecture or need help with lecture materials, please contact the instructor. 
- If you have any questions about whether something is or is not allowed, ask the instructors *beforehand*.

Homework rules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- All the :ref:`General course rules`.
- You are allowed to consult with another student from the current class during the conceptualization of a problem. 
  However, all written work, whether in scrap or final form, are to be generated by you *working alone*.
- You are required to disclose in each homework submission any person that you have discussed the homework with.
- You are *not* allowed to discuss an homework with anyone outside the current class.
- You are *not* allowed to possess, look at, use, or in any way derive advantage from another student's work.
- You are *not* allowed to compare your solutions, whether in scrap paper or final form, to another student.
- You are *not* allowed to use the solutions or assignments prepared in prior semesters, whether the solutions were made available by the instructors in a previous semester or from a former student' work. Note this applies to the students who have taken this class before. 
- You are *not* allowed to self-plagiarize (i.e., using your own previous work (e.g., homework or solutions), especially if you have taken this class before.)
- It is your responsibility to make reasonable efforts to make sure your work is not shared with another student. 
- **Penalty policies**
    - A single offense will result in 0 points for the involved homework and a reduction of three letter grade levels in the final course grade (e.g., from A- to B-). 
    - Multiple offenses in homework will result in a failing grade (E) for the course. 
    - If a student provided unauthorized help to other students, all parties will receive the same penalty.

Project rules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- All the :ref:`General course rules`
- Your team is *not* allowed to receive any help on the project from another person other than the course instructors.
- The essence of all work that you submit for your project must be your own. You are allowed to use code snippets (defined as no more than a few lines of re-usable code) from the internet or elsewhere. However, the snippet must not constitute the core part of your work. And you need to properly cite the code snippets that you borrowed elsewhere.
- You are not allowed to self-plagiarize, meaning that you can not submit your own previously work (e.g., from another course that you took or are currently taking).
- **Penalty policies**: An offense in an project may result in up to receiving a failing grade (E) for the course for all team members at the instructor's discretion. 

.. warning::
    All Honor Code violations will be penalized to the full extent specified by the "penalty policies" section *and* reported to the University's Academic Integrity Board (AIB) *with no exceptions*.
